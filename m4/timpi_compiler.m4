  dnl See whether we are using PETSC_CXX. Unfortunately PETSC_CXX may
  dnl be prefixed with a PATH, and its not straightforward to strip it off.
  dnl If CXX is not set AC_PROG_CXX will call AC_CHECK_TOOLS which will prefix
  dnl every argument in CXX_TRY_LIST with values in $PATH, so we will
  dnl not find something like PATH/PETSC_PREFIX/mpicxx. The solution
  dnl then is just to set CXX to PETSC_CXX so that AC_CHECK_TOOLS
  dnl never gets called
  AS_IF([test -z "$CXX" && test x"$PETSC_HAVE_MPI" = x1 && test x"$PETSC_CXX" != x],

  dnl If we still don't have a CXX set then we will try to pick one up from CXX_TRY_LIST
